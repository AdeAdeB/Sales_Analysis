### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. What is the total revenue generated?
2. What is the profit margin for the year?
3. What month has the highest sales?
4. Which of the products are best sellers of the year?

### Results/Findings
The following insights were made from the analysis:
1. The sales flunctuated as there were low sales during the first quater of the year, increasing during the second quarter, decreasing by the third quarter, and finally increasing by the fourth quarter. In summary, January has the lowest sales and December has the highest sales.
2. Tuesday is the best selling day per week.
3. iPhone proved to be the most sold product over the year.
4. The top 5 best selling products are AAA Batteries, AA Batteries, USB-C Charging Cable, Lightening Changing Cable, and wired headphones.

### Recommendations
- Analysis is a very important aspect of sales, some products might be the best sold products and still be the less profitable products. Analysis should be made per quarter of the year.
- Marketing should be done for other products to increase sales and profits.
